# DFSMSimulator

Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

It is a finite state machine that accepts and rejects strings of symbols and only produces a unique computation of the automation
for each input string.

DFA is often implemented in hardware and software to model various things like to model a software. Like string searching, email verification or designing commumnication protocol


This program is the simulation of DFSM.

It takes two inputs namely the name of file containing the transition table for DFSM and a string to test whether it is accepted by the given DFSM or not.

In this project we simulate a DFSM from a transition table and verify if a given string is accepted or not.
